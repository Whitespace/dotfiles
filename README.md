Tom's dotfiles
==============

I use `oh-my-zsh` and `vim` with `powerline` mode on OS X.

There are two files: my `.zshrc` and my `.vimrc`.  You'll need to install powerline and powerline fonts.

*Do not* install MacVim, since powerline doesn't work well with it.  Using regular `vim` and `ctrl-z` together is a lot nicer anyway.
